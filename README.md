during my life from start to finish to start again, these thougts and the mind body and soul that they began invading never DID claim them as mine.  i saw myself as your host.  a good host.  you're ghost, here to serve you and maybe see the pattern one day.  surely by now you are real and i am the one you will never recognize in person.
